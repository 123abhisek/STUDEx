            Why STUDEx Exists
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            During my sophomore year, I hit rock bottom. Failing classes, losing motivation, and feeling completely directionless, I desperately searched for resources that understood what I was going through.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            All I found were generic advice articles and success stories that felt completely unattainable. What I needed was to hear from real students who had been where I was and found their way through.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            STUDEx was born from that frustration. We're creating the resource I wish I had â€” a platform where students share authentic stories of struggle and breakthrough, where practical tools meet genuine empathy, and where no one has to feel alone in their challenges.
